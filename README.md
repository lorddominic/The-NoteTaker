## Description
Template-Engine is a project that requires us to create a team member and show it on a HTML page. The program will prompt the user different questions by using inquirer. User will choose his/her profession including manager, engineer or intern. Each profession has its own information on the team member. This is a good practice of creating classes and using extends method to do the inheritance.
